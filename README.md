# Human-Thoughts

Here's my idea: Visualize all the topics people talk about. Gonna download transcripts of a bunch of podcasts, label them, and make a big excel sheet out of them. Then visualize it using tools like nomic.ai

(If only I had enough time to work on this, currently so burned out)

Just a thought, that this looks at human thoughts logically, but it can't capture the emotion of what was said, so it may be hard to figure out emotions using this method. Listening to the way it's spoken or watching body language is better in understanding emotions but how do you map that out on a large scale?
